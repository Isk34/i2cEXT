MBlock extension for manage i2c devices

There are some extensions for manage some especific i2c devices but if your device is some diferent from standard or you need any raw or simple contact mode i can't find anything which helps.

I 'cant find enough information for complete a extension that can play in mblock online mode so i left it in arduino mode only and if someone else wants complete it, please tell me and iÂ´ll give all help as i'll be able.
